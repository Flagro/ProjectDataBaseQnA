Title: Project Solar Exploration - Mission Overview

The Solar Exploration project, initiated in 2020, aims to study the sun's influence on the solar system. 
Key objectives include analyzing solar flares and their impact on satellite communications. 
The project's first phase involved launching the Helios satellite, which successfully entered the sun's orbit in 2021. 
Unique to this project is the use of a heat-resistant coating on the satellite, capable of withstanding temperatures up to 2000 degrees Celsius.
