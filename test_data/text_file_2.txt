Title: Deep Sea Discovery Program - Achievements and Challenges

The Deep Sea Discovery program, started in 2018, focuses on exploring oceanic depths below 3,000 meters. 
It's notable for discovering over 50 new marine species in the Mariana Trench. 
One significant challenge faced is the extreme pressure at such depths, reaching over 1,000 atmospheres. 
The program's latest venture includes deploying the Abyss Explorer, an unmanned submersible equipped with advanced pressure-resistant technology.
